## Getting Started

The quickest way to use streamhub-gallery is to use the built version hosted on Livefyre's CDN.

### Dependencies

streamhub-gallery depends on [streamhub-sdk](https://github.com/livefyre/streamhub-sdk). Ensure it's been included in your page.

	<script src="http://cdn.livefyre.com/libs/sdk/v2.0.0/streamhub-sdk.min.gz.js"></script>

Include streamhub-gallery too.

	<script src="http://cdn.livefyre.com/libs/apps/Livefyre/streamhub-gallery/v0.2.2-build.14/streamhub-gallery.min.js"></script>
	
Optionally, include some reasonable default CSS rules for StreamHub Content. This stylesheet is provided by the StreamHub SDK.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.livefyre.com/libs/sdk/v2.0.0/streamhub-sdk.gz.css" />

### Usage

1. Require streamhub-sdk and streamhub-gallery

        var GalleryView = Livefyre.require('streamhub-gallery');
    
1. Now let's provide a Livefyre Collection to the ```GalleryView```. This is the source of the social content we want to display

		var Collection = Livefyre.require('streamhub-sdk/collection');
        var collection = new Collection({
            network: "labs.fyre.co",
            siteId: 315833,
            articleId: 'example'
        });
        
1. Create a GalleryView, passing the DOMElement to render it in (```el``` option).

        var view = new GalleryView({
        	el: document.getElementById("myGallery")
    	});
    
1. Pipe the collection's content into the ```GalleryView```

        collection.pipe(view);

### Changing Themes

The ```GalleryView``` constructor accepts the ```animator``` option. By passing in an instance of a ```Animator```, the Gallery view can be customized to visualize a stream to your liking. There are two animators included, ```streamhub-gallery/animators/coverflow-animator``` and ```streamhub-gallery/animators/carousel-animator```.

        var CoverflowAnimator = Livefyre.require('streamhub-gallery/animators/coverflow-animator');
        var view = new GalleryView({
        	el: document.getElementById("myGallery"),
        	animator: new CoverflowAnimator()
    	});

### Number of Visible Content Slides

By default, 3 content items will appear to before/after the focused content item. If you wish to adjust the number of visible adjacent items, specifiy the ```numVisible``` option for the ```GalleryView``` constructor.

    var view = new GalleryView({
        el: document.getElementById("myGallery"),
        numVisible: 8 // Eight visible items before/after the active content view
    });

## Local Development

Instead of using a built version of streamhub-gallery from Livefyre's CDN, you may wish to fork, develop on the repo locally, or include it in your existing JavaScript application.

Clone this repo

    git clone https://github.com/Livefyre/streamhub-gallery

Development dependencies are managed by [npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm), which you should install first.

With npm installed, install streamhub-gallery's dependencies. This will also download [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) and use it to install browser dependencies.

    cd streamhub-gallery
    npm install

This repository's package.json includes a helpful script to launch a web server for development

    npm start

You can now visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see an example feed loaded via RequireJS.
